<p>The most dangerous hacker these days probably isn’t a hoodie-clad coder hunched in a basement, furiously typing to break through firewalls. It’s the scammer who sent you a friendly text: “Are you coming to my BBQ tonight?” A simple reply could lead to your savings or identity being stolen.</p>
<p>As tech companies have fortified their systems, cybercriminals have changed tactics, realizing they don’t need to break in if they can manipulate someone into letting them in. That shift has fueled a surge in fraud, with <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-annual-internet-crime-report">more than $16 billion</a> drained from bank accounts last year in the U.S. alone, skyrocketing from $3 billion five years earlier. Given vast underreporting, the amount stolen through fraud crimes is <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/federal-trade-commission-protecting-older-adults-report_102024.pdf">likely far higher</a>.</p>
<p>One way Microsoft is countering these threats is by partnering user experience (UX) designers with threat analysts, helping make protection intuitive so people don’t have to be experts to stay safe online. Its new <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/secure-by-design-a-ux-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure by Design UX Toolkit</a>, tested across 20 product teams, is now available to other companies and organizations, too, to help them build safer digital experiences. </p>
<p>Cybercriminals “have been taking advantage of how our brains work” through social engineering — manipulating people into believing and acting on something that isn’t true, says Kathy Stokes, the director of fraud prevention programs for AARP, a nonprofit that advocates for older adults in the U.S.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-1-2-3-1-683x683.jpg" alt="A stylized illustration showing a hand holding a floating cube with an eye and shield symbol, surrounded by flowing ribbons against a coral background with decorative elements." class="wp-image-21415" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c01ee564352e3f69ac462f80bf3a5959">“Education is an important part of solving the fraud crisis, but guess what else is an important part? Technology that comes to us secure by design and safe by default,” Stokes says. “We put so much of the onus on the end user to be safe, and it&#8217;s not a fair battle.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d1c9e4658c31f8d99f7de6ce84c91261">That’s exactly the imbalance Margaret Price set out to fix. As a senior director of strategy at Microsoft, Price says she made it her mission last year to change how the company’s tens of thousands of product managers, user researchers, designers and others think about security — by seeing design as a first line of defense.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c79ee558f900edfbe2e02a8835086ce4">“Most security issues are caused by human error,” Price says. “Whether it’s a stolen credential, a confusing privacy setting or accidentally exposed data, these are often outcomes of poor design.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0e6e0f62f7610f0558ef120269ffd8f7">Price’s efforts stemmed from the company-wide <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Future Initiative</a> that rolled out in 2023 and made security every employee’s top priority. Price gathered a team and interviewed more than 70 security experts to understand common vulnerabilities and learn how cybercriminals exploit design gaps. The result: a toolkit that helps product teams bake security into the user experience from the start, instead of retrofitting for it later. The toolkit has rolled out to 22,000 employees, and now other companies are starting to use it to help them design safer, more intuitive experiences using Microsoft products.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2bae19c8ff6138ef75dea43caeef8f4a">It&#8217;s a distinct approach and a new way of thinking about both security and product development.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-3-3-683x683.png" alt="A person typing on a laptop surrounded by digital security symbols including cubes with eye and shield icons, password asterisks, and fingerprint elements on a yellow and black background." class="wp-image-21423" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-02febe3d6cce415a2b8f6efa5b821977">UX has usually been an afterthought in security, says David Weston, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and OS security. Product teams didn’t realize for quite some time that if users were flooded with yes-or-no prompts, for example, they’d be habituated to clicking through without really reading risk alerts.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-891713a37d2152adc22a2348bd9d9d6c">“Sometimes the impact was catastrophic,” he recalls, noting the recent shift toward seeing designers as “our most important defenders” has made a “night and day” difference.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bef6cfc303a4fb385462ea667ef4f8e1">This design-first approach is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/17/microsofts-secure-by-design-journey-one-year-of-success/">already showing up</a> in Microsoft products, says Marcus Ash, who leads design and research for Windows.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-daa91c17b971e28a779a7c1de08d7b44">Smart App Control uses AI to block unknown or suspicious apps from running. It not only stops the threat but explains why and suggests safer alternatives from Microsoft’s app store, effectively extending the reach of security professionals to everyday users.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-313b42fab8951e2727d33f4215c6aacd">Microsoft Teams phishing alerts now display full email addresses, rather than just a name, to expose impersonators and flag when a domain doesn’t match a sender’s claimed company.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-19e6b23121ea3eeb3536a3770b5ad974">And <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-passkey">passkeys</a> are replacing passwords with more secure authentication methods that are simpler to use as well, like facial recognition or a PIN through the Windows Hello sign-in experience that only works on your machine and can’t be shared or stolen. As of May 1, all new Microsoft accounts have gone <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/">password-free</a>.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-44a24cb69777f661b4c0f87ec3fd37d0">That new technology is a great example of how good design goes hand-in-hand with communication to help users make better security decisions, Weston says. Powerful advances in security can’t protect users if they don’t understand them or how to adopt them — something that’s even more important since Windows is an open platform that gives users more choice than other operating systems do, he says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-2-2-3-683x683.png" alt="A collage illustration showing a hand holding a padlock with 'AI' text, surrounded by flowing black lines, social media icons, and digital elements on a coral background." class="wp-image-21416" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a777077aec1e2ba11ef440e8ee2d1e38">“A lot of our recent security work is about simplifying,” Ash says, “making it easier for our users to understand when they need to jump into something and correct it.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6de126e7de1e62566a24da6e81561cc1">Trust and clarity are especially important, says Alistair Kilpatrick, principal design director for Windows, as technology moves toward an agentic future — a world where AI-powered agents can act on users’ behalf, with their permission, and access to their personal data and credit card information.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-edf2ddef0193bf33d74d447382c74a3f">“These foundations need to be there in place to build customer trust,” Kilpatrick says.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7912b1b6edc43c620129d522f19ba82e">The right amount of friction is key — making security features less complicated and easier to enact so people aren’t loathe to adopt them, while also alerting users to danger in a way that forces them to take notice.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-149fadd2e7a964bab195546fe43e0602">Tech companies can help users understand that friction “is not a four-letter word,” AARP’s Stokes says. “Friction is a protection.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6b0a63c0f99a4ad1c8e34c1ba0abc67a">Even small design choices as simple as where a button is placed, how a pop-up alert is worded, or whether the look of a page or program is consistent with others can help users recognize when something is off and avoid danger.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-4-2-683x683.jpg" alt="A person using a laptop with cybersecurity elements including a padlock, password symbols, security cubes with eye and shield icons, and digital interface graphics on a coral and yellow background." class="wp-image-21412" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-94a885816bbddf05c9eaf31626dccede">“You&#8217;re a gamer, you&#8217;re someone that&#8217;s a creative, you&#8217;re someone that&#8217;s trying to be productive, we don&#8217;t want you to worry about these things,” Ash says. “We design a simple user experience that is secure by default. This helps our users understand the protection we put in place and the risks if they decide to make changes.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c3b960ca37d4a667fcc8c5fad61bebe1">Cybercrime isn’t just a tech issue — it’s a <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/fbi-report-fraud-2024/?intcmp=AE-FRDSC-MOR-R2-POS3">public safety crisis</a>, Stokes says. Scams are draining retirement funds, eroding trust and leaving people vulnerable and dependent on social safety nets. To help people resist the emotional manipulation behind modern tech scams, AARP has launched a national campaign with an easy-to-remember mantra meant to help users in the same way broad seatbelt or fire-drill campaigns have done in the past: <a href="https://www.aarp.org/videos/money/scams-fraud/6373940168112.html">“Pause. Reflect. Protect.”</a></p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2fdb935058ec06f54f5e4410433a95e8">That’s why Microsoft is innovating to make security feel less like a burden and more like a built-in benefit, Price says.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-176e81afdda5657f21ce0e7d51dcde42">“We want security to be woven into everyday products to make experiences safer for everyone,” Price says. “That would mean fewer scams, fewer account breaches, more confidence and more trust in the digital tools people use every day.”</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI offers retail and consumer goods brands a wealth of solutions that transform creativity and reduce time and cost of resource-intensive tasks across the content supply chain. As witnessed at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity in June 2025, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-advertising-industry-parties-in-cannes-with-ai-as-its-new-plus-one-00443954?msockid=331ef648934d63d435b8e27a92f76280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI is the new “plus one”</a> to marketing chiefs and agency leaders. However, the potential of AI unleashed new pressure to chief marketing officers to not only scale proof of concepts (POCs), but prove their value—all while keeping the marketing engine running at a breakneck pace.</p>
<p>For consumer packaged goods (CPGs), delivering personalized content across channels requires multiple iterations of product images, constant reshoots, tweaks, packaging design adjustments, and localization by region. This can be all-consuming for creatives, who are rebuilding or recreating imagery constantly to meet the moment.</p>
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/retail/microsoft-cloud-for-retail">Discover solutions with Microsoft Cloud for Retail</a></div>
</div>
<p>Imagine if brands could leverage AI <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/digital-twin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital twins</a> to create and integrate high-quality, personalized product content at scale—simply, cost-effectively, and in a fraction of the time. AI and 3D digital twins make it possible, proving AI investments deliver on reduced time and speed to innovation.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/retail/2025/01/16/how-cmos-can-personalize-marketing-and-optimize-spend-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent post</a>, we discussed how AI isn’t just a tool—it’s the foundation for building competitive advantage. Let’s walk through three strategic areas where digital twins offer exceptional outcomes for marketing teams looking to deliver more.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-starting-with-product-imagery">1. Starting with product imagery</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/how-ai-helping-cmos-their-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to EMARKETER</a>, content creation will be the top budget priority AI use case for chief marketing officers worldwide. Why? Producing product images today requires brands to spend a massive chunk of their budget to constantly reshoot and edit images. With digital twins, brands have the flexibility and scalability at low cost to create thousands of variants on a single product image, including labels, packaging, and language formats—all within a single file.</p>
<p>AI empowers not only productivity but <em>creativity</em>. Digital twins are hyper-realistic, enabling content managers to easily and endlessly modify or expand on a concept using a 3D product model with a few clicks. Creatives can reallocate time spent in operational “to do’s” to storytelling, strategy, and delivery by channel. Brands can even showcase products in both static and dynamic formats because AI models aren’t limited to one dimension.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Digital twins for product images, videos, and interactive experiences simplify content workflows and allow you to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Generate endless product images or videos using a single digital twin.</li>
<li>Refresh imagery for markets or seasons without reshoots.</li>
<li>Reduce repetitive labor for creatives while shortening production timelines.</li>
<li>Test creative concepts instantly without adding costs.</li>
<li>Update visuals across brands seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-it-real-nestle-reduces-associated-time-and-cost-by-70-with-scaling-digital-twins">Making it real: Nestlé reduces associated time and cost by 70% with scaling digital twins</h3>
<p>Recently, Nestlé—the world’s largest food and beverage company—collaborated with Microsoft, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-song-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Accenture Song</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/retail-agentic-physical-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA</a> to build and launch a new AI-powered in-house service to create high-quality product content at scale.</p>
<p>With its new digital twin content supply chain powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> on <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Azure</a> and using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft AI solutions</a>, content creators across Nestlé’s 45 content studios around the world can deliver high-quality creative assets at scale for e-commerce and marketing communications. Nestlé’s Integrated Marketing Services (IMS)—250 marketing experts in seven hubs—are working on scaling the digital twins and driving content localization.</p>
<p>Nestlé already has a baseline of 4,000 3D digital products, mainly for global brands, with the ambition to convert a total of 10,000 products into digital twins in the next two years across global and local brands.</p>
<p><strong>Proving the value of AI investments in digital twins</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>70% reduced time and cost associated with scaling digital twins.</li>
<li>Faster content production for several brands, including Purina, Nescafé Dolce Gusto, and Nespresso.</li>
<li>Better ability to position iconic brands in a fast-moving digital environment.</li>
<li>Seamless updates for seasonal campaigns or channel-specific formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nestlé, these technologies are proving to be catalysts for creative ingenuity, revolutionizing creative workflows in design, supercharging content creation, and enabling nuanced personalization—positioning Nestlé at the forefront of marketing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-digital-twins-enable-game-changing-one-to-one-consumer-experiences">2. Digital twins enable game-changing one-to-one consumer experiences</h2>
<p>Digital twins are generating realistic virtual experiences that not only enhance the shopper journey but also hyper-personalize each touchpoint to create memorable brand moments. AI has enabled interoperability between datasets to unlock online configurators, virtual reality product trials and visualizations, and in-store displays.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Embedding AI in user experiences is allowing consumer and retail goods companies to enable:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Try-ons for beauty products and fashion.</li>
<li>Configurators for custom merchandise.</li>
<li>Interactive, 360-degree product views.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-next-level-media-and-creative-together-at-last">3. Next level: Media and creative, together at last</h2>
<p>The era of AI ushers in a world of “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-at-work-intelligence-on-tap-will-reshape-knowledge-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelligence on tap</a>.”</p>
<p>Imagine if AI-powered digital product twins merge product imagery and consumer insights to create visuals targeted to specific audience segments or even individual customers.</p>
<p>A combination of insights and digital twin content creation empowers marketers to optimize for better impact and even map future trends. The value of building digital twins goes beyond endless product image creation. CPG brands are now leveraging AI to connect real-time campaign insights to their content studios as a primary use case to prove value. Agents are being built to perform audience simulations, test images, content, and even segmentation strategy to drive higher return on ad spend (ROAS) or even predict impact.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Use AI to connect media insights and content to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Simulate, refine, and test marketing scenarios and consumer responses.</li>
<li>Increase campaign effectiveness with real-time, iterative feedback.</li>
<li>Test and optimize personalized marketing strategies at scale.</li>
<li>Model customer segments and predict campaign outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-as-a-tool-to-amplify-human-creativity">AI as a tool to amplify human creativity</h2>
<p>As AI continues to evolve traditional processes and enhance productivity, marketers know human creativity remains a critical resource. With digital simulations and AI together, you can reallocate your valuable resources to more strategic, creative tasks; reduce costs and risk; and help your marketing teams optimize spend and focus on your number one KPI: growth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficiency-without-compromise">Efficiency without compromise&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning balances math reasoning ability with efficiency, making it potentially suitable for educational applications, real-time logic-based applications, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Similar to its predecessor, Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is a 3.8 billion parameter open model optimized for advanced math reasoning. It supports a 64K token context length and is fine-tuned on high-quality synthetic data to deliver reliable, logic-intensive performance deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-s-new">What&#8217;s new?</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At the core of Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is the newly introduced decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture, SambaY, whose central innovation is the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for sharing representations between layers.&nbsp; The architecture includes a self-decoder that combines Mamba (a State Space Model) and Sliding Window Attention (SWA), along with a single layer of full attention. The architecture also involves a cross-decoder that interleaves expensive cross-attention layers with the new, efficient GMUs. This new architecture with GMU modules&nbsp;drastically improves decoding efficiency, boosts long-context retrieval performance and enables the architecture to deliver exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Key benefits of the SambaY architecture include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Enhanced decoding efficiency.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Preserves linear prefiling time complexity.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Increased scalability and enhanced long context performance.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Up to 10 times higher throughput.</li>
</ul>

Gated Memory Units (GMUs) are interleaved with the cross-attention layers in the cross-decoder to reduce the decoding computation complexity. As in YOCO [SDZ+24], the full attention layer only computes the KV cache during the prefilling with the self-decoder, leading to linear computation complexity for the prefill stage.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning-benchmarks">Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning benchmarks&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Like all models in the Phi family, Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is deployable on a single GPU, making it accessible for a broad range of use cases. However, what sets it apart is its architectural advantage. This new model achieves significantly lower latency and higher throughput compared to Phi-4-mini-reasoning, particularly in long-context generation and latency-sensitive reasoning tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This makes Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning a compelling option for developers and enterprises looking to deploy intelligent systems that require fast, scalable, and efficient reasoning—whether on premises or on-device.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-agents-and-knowledge-work-meeting-the-next-frontier-of-research-automation">AI agents and knowledge work: Meeting the next frontier of research automation</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Generative AI and large language models have made research and analysis faster than ever, powering solutions like ChatGPT Deep Research and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/researcher-agent-in-microsoft-365-copilot/4397186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researcher in Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> for individuals and teams. These tools are transforming everyday productivity and document workflows for millions of users.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As organizations look to take the next step—integrating deep research directly into their business apps, automating multi-step processes, and governing knowledge at enterprise scale—the need for programmable, composable, and auditable research automation becomes clear.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is where Azure AI Foundry and Deep Research come in: offering the flexibility to embed, extend, and orchestrate world-class research as a service across your entire enterprise ecosystem—and connect it with your data and your systems.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deep-research-capabilities-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service">Deep Research capabilities in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service</h2>

<div class="ms-metrics-youtube-player"></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unlike packaged chat assistants, Deep Research in Foundry Agent Service can evolve with your needs—ready for automation, extensibility, and integration with future internal data sources as we expand support.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works-architecture-and-agent-flow">How it works: Architecture and agent flow</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Deep Research in Foundry Agent Service is architected for flexibility, transparency, and composability—so you can automate research that’s as robust as your business demands.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At its core, the Deep Research model, o3-deep-research,&nbsp;orchestrates a <strong>multi-step research pipeline</strong> that’s tightly integrated with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounding with Bing Search</a>&nbsp;and leverages the latest OpenAI models:</p>
<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Clarifying intent and scoping the task:</strong><br />When a user or downstream app submits a research query, the agent uses GPT-series models including GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 to clarify the question, gather additional context if needed, and precisely scope the research task. This ensures the agent’s output is both relevant and actionable, and that every search is optimized for your business scenario.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Web grounding with Bing Search:</strong><br />Once the task is scoped, the agent securely invokes the Grounding with Bing Search tool to gather a curated set of high-quality, recent web data. This ensures the research model is working from a foundation of authoritative, up-to-date sources—no hallucinations from stale or irrelevant content.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Deep Research task execution:</strong><br />The o3-deep-research model starts the&nbsp;research task&nbsp;execution. This involves&nbsp;thinking, analyzing, and synthesizing information across all discovered sources. Unlike simple summarization, it reasons step-by-step, pivots as it encounters new insights, and composes a comprehensive answer that’s sensitive to nuance, ambiguity, and emerging patterns in the data.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Transparency, safety, and compliance:</strong><br />The final output is a structured report that documents not only the answer, but also the model’s reasoning path, source citations, and any clarifications requested during the session. This makes every answer fully auditable—a must-have for regulated industries and high-stakes use cases.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong><strong>Programmatic integration and composition</strong>:</strong><br />By exposing Deep Research as an API, Azure AI Foundry empowers you to invoke research from anywhere—custom business apps, internal portals, workflow automation tools, or as part of a larger agent ecosystem. For example, you can trigger a research agent as part of a multi-agent chain: one agent performs deep web analysis, another generates a slide deck with Azure Functions, while a third emails the result to decision makers with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/logic-apps/?msockid=36d156f74ff96d723016422b4e966cdb">Azure Logic Apps</a>. This composability is the real game-changer: research is no longer a manual, one-off task, but a building block for digital transformation and continuous intelligence.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This flexible architecture means Deep Research can be seamlessly embedded into a wide range of enterprise workflows and applications. Already, organizations across industries are evaluating how these programmable research agents can streamline high-value scenarios—from market analysis and competitive intelligence, to large-scale analytics and regulatory reporting.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Pricing for Deep Research (model: <strong>o3-deep-research</strong>) is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Input:</strong> $10.00 per 1M tokens.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Generative AI is a transformative force, redefining how modern enterprises operate. It has quickly become central to how businesses drive productivity, innovate, and deliver impact. The pressure is on: organizations must move fast to not only adopt AI, but to unlock real value at scale or risk falling behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Achieving enterprise-wide deployment of AI securely and efficiently is no easy feat. Generative AI is like rocket fuel. It can propel businesses to new heights, but only with the right infrastructure and controls in place. To accelerate safely and strategically, enterprises are turning to <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com">Microsoft Azure</a> as mission control. Tapping into Azure’s powerful cloud infrastructure and advanced security solutions allows teams to effectively build, deploy, amplify, and see real results from generative AI.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To understand how businesses are preparing for AI, we commissioned Forrester Consulting to <a href="https://tei.forrester.com/go/Microsoft/AzureAIReadiness/?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey Azure customers</a>. The resulting 2024 Forrester Total Economic Impact<sup>TM</sup> study uncovers the steps businesses take to become AI-ready, the challenges of adopting generative AI in the cloud, and how Azure’s scalable infrastructure and built-in security helps businesses deploy AI with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://tei.forrester.com/go/Microsoft/AzureAIReadiness/?lang=en-us"><strong>Read the full study to learn how organizations are leveraging Azure for AI-readiness and to run generative AI securely in the cloud</strong></a></div>
</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-with-scaling-generative-ai-on-premises">Challenges with scaling generative AI on-premises&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scaling generative AI is like designing transportation systems for a rapidly growing city. Just as urban expansion demands modern transportation infrastructure to function efficiently, AI leaders understand that implementing AI in a meaningful way requires a cloud foundation that is powerful, flexible, and built to handle future demand. AI leaders recognize that the power and agility of the cloud is needed to achieve their desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">In fact, 72% of surveyed respondents whose organization migration to Azure for AI-readiness reported that the migration was necessary or reduced the barriers to enabling AI.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">65% of business leaders agreed that deploying generative AI in the cloud would meet their organizational objectives to avoid restrictions and limitations of on-prem deployments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Businesses that run most or all of their generative AI workloads on-premises face significant roadblocks. On-premises systems, often lacking the agility offered by the cloud, resemble outdated roadways—prone to congestion, difficult to maintain, expensive to expand, and ill-equipped for today’s demands. Businesses attempting to scale AI in these environments encounter complicated obstacles—including infrastructure limitations, a shortage of specialized talent, and integration challenges that slow innovation—that are frustrating to overcome. Challenges like limited network bandwidth and fragmented data environments further complicate adoption.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Deploying generative AI safely is crucial to protecting sensitive data, maintaining compliance, and mitigating risk. Surveyed decision-makers identified four key areas of concerns:&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Data privacy risks</strong>, especially with the proliferation of AI-generated content.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Lack of expertise </strong>regarding generative AI security best practices.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Compliance complexities</strong> with evolving regulations around AI use and data protection.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Shadow IT risks</strong>, as users turn to unauthorized tools and apps, exposing organizations to vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To overcome these challenges, it’s important to partner with a cloud platform that provides built-in security and regulatory compliance. Cloud migration provides the scalable infrastructure, integrated applications, and AI-ready data foundation necessary for generative AI success. Survey respondents who have already transitioned many or all AI workloads to Azure report enhanced global reach, scalability, and flexibility, all major advantages in today’s rapidly evolving AI landscape.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="realizing-the-promise-of-data-driven-research-through-ai">Realizing the promise of data-driven research through AI&nbsp;</h2>
<p>AI is rapidly changing the nature and value of advanced analytics in research. Traditional analytics have long helped firms understand what happened and why—but AI is helping them predict what will happen next and prescribe optimal courses of action in real time.</p>
<p>This shift from retrospective analysis to proactive intelligence can help firms unlock new sources of value and ultimately develop groundbreaking new products that redefine the competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As innovative firms recognize the potential of AI, they also see the opportunity to address longstanding challenges that hinder effective research. Among these:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Data overload and complexity</strong><br />Financial markets are inundated with massive volumes of data from diverse, often siloed sources that can be difficult to integrate and synthesize. This makes it hard to access the right data at the right time, which can slow decision-making and heighten risk. As data requirements become more complex, solutions are needed that can unify, structure, and analyze data at scale to deliver timely, actionable insights.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmented workflows across user journeys</strong><br />Research analysts frequently struggle to navigate large volumes of disparate data housed in disconnected systems, tools, and formats, leading to time-consuming manual data compilation and synthesis. The increase in non-integrated tools, applications, and data structures disrupts business workflows and can lead to inefficiencies, duplication of effort, errors of omission, and delays in decision-making.</li>
<li><strong>Dependency on traditional data sources</strong><br />Many firms and analysts rely heavily on conventional market reference data, company fundamentals, industry reports, and databases, which often lack real-time insights and limit the speed and accuracy of market predictions. As new opportunities arise, firms need solutions that can extract more value out of existing sources while also making it easy to incorporate alternative and real-time sources—enhancing both predictive accuracy and responsiveness to market shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Information overload and time constraints</strong><br />Research and analyst professionals are always challenged to keep up with reports, emails, meetings, and chats. The overload tends to slow decision-making and increases the risk of missed opportunities. Stringent regulatory compliance requirements add additional demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="five-ways-ai-redefines-the-value-of-research-in-financial-services">Five ways AI redefines the value of research in financial services&nbsp;</h2>
<p>AI gives financial services firms new solutions to these longstanding barriers and opportunities to use data in new ways that can differentiate their offerings. Here are five important areas where AI can change the game:&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-advance-analysis-with-ai-powered-analytics">1. Advance analysis with AI-powered analytics&nbsp;</h3>
<p>AI-powered analytics empower research analysts to cut through the noise of information overload and extract valuable insights with unprecedented speed and precision. The combination of AI with predictive analytics empowers researchers to analyze historical patterns more deeply, identify emerging trends, and make more informed investment decisions. This can ultimately help to improve engagement and win rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A prime example of this is our partnership with Moody’s where we <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2023/06/29/moodys-and-microsoft-develop-enhanced-risk-data-analytics-research-and-collaboration-solutions-powered-by-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developed innovative solutions</a> for research and risk assessment. Moody&#8217;s Research Assistant significantly increases productivity and effectiveness, with users reporting up to 80% time savings on data collection and 50% on analysis during the pilot phase.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-accelerate-operational-efficiency-through-intelligent-automation">2. Accelerate operational efficiency through intelligent automation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Traditional research processes—such as manual data compilation, synthesis, and report generation—are time-consuming and error-prone. AI-powered automation transforms them by integrating data sources, automating repetitive tasks, and promoting seamless collaboration across teams, which results in faster turnaround times, reduced operational costs, and improved operational efficiency. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With tools like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/copilot-for-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Copilot</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/03/25/introducing-researcher-and-analyst-in-microsoft-365-copilot/?msockid=3ffcf3f0da3569e92687e70cdbbe6859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researcher agent, and Analyst agent</a>, firms can significantly boost productivity and operational efficiency. These AI-powered assistants can handle such tasks as summarizing investor reports and earnings calls, creating presentation-ready visualizations from raw data, and drafting research documents and client-ready insights quickly. This frees up valuable time for analysts to focus on higher-value activities, such as strategic analysis and client engagement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-deliver-real-time-insights">3. Deliver real-time insights&nbsp;</h3>
<p>To help meet the accelerating pace of business, AI-powered applications empower financial services firms to surface real-time insights from a variety of sources including market news, earnings reports, and social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bridging knowledge across platforms helps analysts identify emerging trends faster and develop better investment strategies. For example, AI can continuously monitor global news sources and sentiment signals to identify early indicators of market shifts and potential disruptions. Firms can then use this information to react swiftly and make proactive investment decisions ahead of competitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firms can build new AI-powered solutions that incorporate real-time data into advanced searches, personalization, and recommendations, using innovations like the powerful <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/firstderivativesplc1596469572732.kdb-ai-deployment?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vector database built by KX</a>—essentially, a specialized system that understands the meaning and context of a huge set of data types such as text, images, or PDFs. It aims to help financial institutions seize opportunities faster by turning real-time data into real-time action.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-empower-employees-with-high-value-experiences">4. Empower employees with high-value experiences&nbsp;</h3>
<p>AI-powered tools can transform how financial services professionals work with tools and solutions that support the most critical research functions, such as financial modeling and pitchbook preparation. Processes can be significantly streamlined while remaining interoperable, secure, and compliant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the innovation resulting from our <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2022/12/11/empowering-the-future-of-financial-markets-with-london-stock-exchange-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term strategic partnership with LSEG</a> (London Stock Exchange Group) to transform data with next-generation productivity and analytics solutions. One recent advancement is the launch of the <a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/data-analytics/products/workspace/updates/lseg-launches-workspace-add-in-for-excel-and-powerpoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LSEG Workspace Add-in</a>, which integrates AI-powered insights into Excel and PowerPoint. With features like contextual data discovery and interactive charting, the add-in can help financial professionals work faster and more insightfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reducing the burden of manual tasks can also help boost job satisfaction. The integration of AI into daily workflows helps people focus on more intellectually stimulating activities, freeing up time for higher-value analysis and strategic thinking, and helping to attract and retain top talent.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="5-deepen-market-understanding">5. Deepen market understanding&nbsp;</h3>
<p>AI-powered analytics are transforming how analysts understand markets and convert insights into action. By processing vast amounts of financial data in real-time, AI can uncover complex patterns and correlations that were previously undetectable, such as market sentiment from news articles and social media or a real-time pulse on investor sentiment or market dynamics. Machine learning models can predict stock price movements with greater accuracy by integrating diverse data sources, including economic indicators and company performance metrics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A richer view of market forces and dynamics translates into better decision-making and sharper investment strategies. It helps firms anticipate emerging risks and opportunities sooner, enabling them to respond faster and more confidently in an increasingly volatile market landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="now-is-the-time-for-agentic-ai">Now is the time for agentic AI&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A new class of AI tools will soon deliver the ability to plan, reason, and take actions to achieve goals. In financial services, they will be able to gather, analyze, and contextualize information autonomously from diverse sources and proactively surface relevant insights—or even suggest strategic actions based on real-time developments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the near horizon, advanced “orchestrator” agents will focus on new capabilities in distinct functional areas such as market intelligence, data aggregation, strategy simulation, reporting, and compliance. This holds the potential for powerful competitive advantages, helping analysts to stay ahead of market shifts, make more accurate predictions, and deliver higher-impact recommendations.&nbsp;</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="wp-block-paragraph">A new <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/breaking-down-infinite-workday" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Work Trend Index special report</a><sup>1</sup> based on trillions of globally aggregated and anonymized productivity signals in Microsoft 365 reveals a new state of work: a seemingly infinite workday. Our data suggests that work is bleeding into early mornings, late nights, and everything in between: confirming what many people already feel.</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>40%</strong> of people online at 6 AM are already reviewing email to prioritize their day.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">The average employee receives <strong>100+</strong> emails and <strong>150+</strong> Microsoft Teams messages each day.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Most employees send or receive <strong>50+</strong> Teams messages outside of core working hours.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In our review, we saw that nearly one in three employees say it&#8217;s impossible to keep up with today&#8217;s pace of work. At a time when knowledge work has reached peak inefficiency, AI can be a lifeline—but it’s only part of the solution. Now is the time for leaders to rethink how work and teams are structured or risk accelerating a broken system. That means focusing on the 20% of work that drives 80% of the impact; designing flatter, more agile teams around the work chart, not the org chart; and reskilling every employee to be an agent boss.</p>
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Try Copilot Chat today</a></div>
</div>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/2025-the-year-the-frontier-firm-is-born#section-intelligence-on-tap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frontier Firms</a>—organizations rethinking work with AI at the center—are already seeing the impact. Our data shows that employees at these firms are more likely to say their company is thriving, more likely to say they can take on more work, and report having more opportunities to do meaningful work.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Let&#8217;s take a closer look at three strategies every leader needs to know now to adopt a Frontier Firm mindset:</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-apply-the-80-20-rule">1. Apply the 80/20 rule</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Yesterday’s work practices won’t cut it in the age of AI. The companies that will win won’t just work harder, they’ll work smarter—focusing on the 20% of work that delivers 80% of the impact—and ruthlessly streamline the rest.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">AI can now reason and solve complex problems in truly remarkable ways, giving every business intelligence on demand that will rewrite the rules of business and transform knowledge work as we know it. Traditionally, companies have hired more employees or tapped more capital (financing, infrastructure, equipment) to increase output. Now, they can add digital labor in the form of reasoning agents to the mix.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Take <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/06/02/researcher-and-analyst-are-now-generally-available-in-microsoft-365-copilot/">Researcher</a> in Microsoft 365 Copilot, an agent that tackles multistep research at work, delivering insights with greater quality and accuracy than previously possible. It combines OpenAI’s deep research model with Microsoft 365 Copilot’s advanced orchestration and deep search capabilities. One good Researcher use case: white papers. I recently had a brief window—between a business trip and a family wedding—to deliver a timely paper to my team. In the past it would have taken me a few days to research, analyze, write, and edit. Working with Researcher, however, I was able to create a good draft, edit it in a single work block, and deliver a solid white paper to my team within a couple of hours.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-redesign-for-the-work-chart">2. Redesign for the work chart</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Today, most companies structure their people and teams around org charts—marketing, finance, engineering—that are too rigid to leverage the opportunity that intelligence on demand offers. Frontier Firms organize differently, forgoing the org chart and embracing the work chart: agile, outcome-driven teams that form around a goal and use AI to fill skill gaps. On my own team at Microsoft, we’re looking at what we call the “Hollywood Model”: the right talent assembles to make a hit movie and then moves on to the next project. This means lean, dynamic teams that work in short (but intense) sprints, and faster pivots—and adding agents to the team.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Analyst thinks like a skilled data scientist, so your team can go from raw data to insights in minutes. Your team can use it to assess how discounts affect customer behavior, identify top customers who aren’t fully using products they’ve purchased, and visualize product sentiment and usage trends to inform go-to-market decisions.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-empower-every-employee-to-become-an-agent-boss">3. Empower every employee to become an agent boss</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As agents increasingly join the workforce, we’re seeing the rise of the agent boss: an employee who builds, delegates to, and manages agents to amplify their impact—working smarter, scaling faster, and taking control of their career in the age of AI. From the boardroom to the front line, people need to think like the CEO of an agent-powered startup, directing teams of agents with specialized skills like research and data analysis.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">We’ve made it easy to build agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Copilot Studio</a>. These agents can handle approvals, generate orders, manage workflows, and more. A sales professional might use one agent to draft client proposals and another to surface high-potential leads from CRM data. A researcher on my team uses three agents to supercharge his workflow: one scans for new research, another runs complex statistical analyses, and a third drafts briefs and summaries. By offloading time-consuming tasks, he can focus on high-level analysis and new ideas. Another agent boss at Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/how-to-be-an-agent-boss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manages</a> his team of agents much like you would human employees—upskilling underperformers, providing regular feedback, and even conducting performance reviews.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Work is being rewritten in real time. Leaders have an opportunity to help every employee conquer the infinite workday, with a combination of AI and a Frontier Firm mindset. By applying the 80/20 rule, redesigning for the work chart, and empowering every employee to become an agent boss, every organization can transform into a Frontier Firm and seize the opportunity ahead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you ask many city government leaders how to win the hearts of citizens, the answer might very well be “potholes,” or, more specifically, fixing them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Potholes not only tell you about the state of your infrastructure,” noted a Harvard researcher in 2019, “they also tell you about the nature of participation in your city.”<sup>1</sup> A city that fixes a pothole promptly is not just responsive, its constituents feel empowered to engage with government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent years, expectations have only risen on what governments need to deliver, leaving many cities struggling to deliver services in ways people prefer while also running a gauntlet of budgetary, regulatory, and societal challenges. On the one hand, citizens want to access great city services on par with how they do their banking or shopping—that is, secure, personalized experiences on smartphones and computing devices, rather than exclusively in-person. On the other hand, governments face unprecedented pressures in terms of funding, regulations, staffing, and cybercrime.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/government">Achieve your mission with Microsoft for government</a></div>
</div>
<p>To bridge this gap, more and more city governments are looking to use the force-multiplying power of generative AI. Its ability to converse in natural language and reason over vast stores of data, then find answers, compose messages, and orchestrate actions is not only solving longstanding modernization challenges, it’s also opening incredible new frontiers in city services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Helping city governments evaluate, explore, and successfully deploy high-impact solutions with AI is now the primary focus of our work at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/government">Microsoft for government</a>. In cities around the world, we have seen dramatic acceleration in generative AI innovation, with new solutions that are helping cities to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Deliver personalized services.</li>
<li>Empower the professionals who serve the public.</li>
<li>Derive better insights and greater value from data. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-future-of-the-smart-city-is-already-here-in-abu-dhabi">The future of the smart city is already here—in Abu Dhabi&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, launched an ambitious drive around 15 years ago to make government services more accessible and service-oriented. In Abu Dhabi, the nation’s capital, those efforts took a giant leap with the advent of AI, accelerating innovation that led to the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/emea/features/tamm-app-abu-dhabi-government-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch of a new AI-powered government services platform</a> in October 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptly called TAMM—which in Arabic translates to “consider it done!”—the platform began as a centralized portal several years ago and was revised to expand service offerings. With the application of new AI capabilities, it is now a one-stop digital hub, offering access to nearly 950 government services for citizens, residents, visitors, and investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Azure OpenAI</a> service, TAMM uses advanced AI to deliver new classes of benefits. The platform offers real-world examples of how AI can transform smart cities by unifying services and inviting engagement in new and powerful ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are three noteworthy ways that TAMM improves city service delivery.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-serve-people-as-they-like-with-personalized-interactions">1. Serve people as they like, with personalized interactions&nbsp;</h3>
<p>TAMM is designed to remove barriers between government services and the people who need them. In many cases, that means no longer forcing them to go to government buildings to get things done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new TAMM includes a generative AI assistant that provides every day service, offering personalized access to services such as license renewals, utility bill payments, permit applications, healthcare, and more. There’s even a new photo reporting app, where people can take a snapshot of a problem they come across (including, yes, a pothole) and the assistant helps to fill out a report and later sends updates on the progress of repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAMM also helps to untangle bureaucracy to simplify common yet complicated tasks. The process of registering a car, for instance, was dramatically simplified. What previously required days of visiting buildings and standing in lines can now be done quickly through the app—which also recommends the right type of insurance policy and synchronizes it with registration.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-deliver-better-results-with-a-more-energized-and-empowered-workforce">2. Deliver better results with a more energized and empowered workforce&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Because TAMM handles so many more routine tasks than before (such as responding to basic questions on services issues or applications), city employees can focus more on high-value service delivery. With live services including video and audio options, agents can deliver high-touch assistance while still maintaining user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the case of a foreign worker who lived in Abu Dhabi for 10 years and was told by an immigration agent that she couldn’t leave the country due to visa issues. In tears, she opened the TAMM app on her phone and was connected to a helpline, where an agent quickly eased her anxieties. “I said I don’t know what to do, and the agent was literally amazing,” the woman said. “[The agent] said, ‘Don’t worry, it’s getting updated now’—and I was on my way.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The approach to innovation behind TAMM also reflects an important trend: equipping public servants to work like product teams so that city services evolve like platforms. The TAMM organization operates in a unique “factory” in Abu Dhabi that operates like a startup—agile, data-driven, and obsessed with user satisfaction. The city’s employees don’t just execute services; they co-innovate with citizens and stakeholders to create them. Real-time dashboards, productivity-enhancing agents, and a culture of continuous iteration are driving success and proving that empowering the workforce is the foundation of smarter cities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-keep-cities-moving-with-services-that-listen-learn-and-protect">3. Keep cities moving with services that listen, learn, and protect&nbsp;</h3>
<p>TAMM is designed to help people better navigate government services by understanding and responding to user needs almost instantly. It recognizes multiple languages and offers the option for spoken conversations, intelligently walking people through a broad range of complex processes. For example, for a family with a person who has a disability, TAMM can help navigate special services, significantly streamlining a qualification process that previously took weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TAMM not only remembers previous conversations and knows the status of an issue or process, it is also deeply integrated across major government entities in the city. Service can be coordinated with in-person service centers or agencies who help housebound people in their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TAMM platform is powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI service and G42 Compass&nbsp;2.0, a next-generation enterprise AI platform that provides sovereign cloud services. It also uses open-source models, including JAIS, a high-performing Arabic Large Language Model, and Azure OpenAI GPT-4.</p>
<p>The TAMM app now assists Abu Dhabi’s 2.5 million citizens to conduct than 10 million transactions a year. Helping to protect data and ensure privacy within these transactions is the world class cloud<s> </s>security provided by the Microsoft platform—reflecting our commitment to security above all in delivering AI services, as codified in our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/21/securing-our-future-april-2025-progress-report-on-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Futures Initiative</a>.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="keys-for-building-a-foundation-of-success-with-ai">Keys for building a foundation of success with AI&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The noteworthy innovation happening in Abu Dabhi is a great example of a city realizing the transformative potential offered by generative AI. Many others are following the trend, and the results are exciting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we look across the global landscape, we note a set of common factors that consistently underpin successful AI adoption. We would advise every city to consider the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A mission-first mindset drives smarter AI adoption</strong>. Cities that anchor AI initiatives in clearly defined public outcomes—such as reducing response times to citizen queries or improving access to social services—are better equipped to prioritize high-impact use cases and rigorously measure results. Aligning AI innovation with policy goals improves clarity and can also boost community trust.</li>
<li><strong>AI literacy must span the entire workforce</strong>. Successful implementations include investments to build AI literacy across all levels of the public workforce—from IT and data science teams to case workers and city clerks. With effective training and a culture of learning and sharing, cities have more empowered workforces and enjoy better outcomes.</li>
<li><strong>Strong data foundations are critical</strong>. Cities that proactively clean, integrate, and govern their data estates—including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data—are better able to operationalize AI faster, more securely, and at scale. A modern data platform emphasizes robust privacy and access protections as prerequisites for AI success, helping civic leaders avoid common pitfalls such as model bias, incomplete datasets, or compliance gaps.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
