<p>Electricity is no longer just a utility—it’s the backbone of modern life. From the devices in our homes to the data centers powering AI, demand for electricity is surging at a pace our current infrastructure was never designed to handle. As climate goals accelerate electrification across industries and extreme weather events test grid resilience, one truth becomes clear: we can’t afford to build the grid of the future at the pace of the past. And that starts with rethinking how we plan.</p>
<p>In today’s very dynamic environment, technology is needed to make processes even more streamlined, faster, and proactive. Technology can support the planning process to model future demand, quickly assess capacity, and propose solutions in a more real-time environment. If we want to keep pace with the energy transition, we need to move from static studies to dynamic, data-driven planning.

<p>The most dangerous hacker these days probably isn’t a hoodie-clad coder hunched in a basement, furiously typing to break through firewalls. It’s the scammer who sent you a friendly text: “Are you coming to my BBQ tonight?” A simple reply could lead to your savings or identity being stolen.</p>
<p>As tech companies have fortified their systems, cybercriminals have changed tactics, realizing they don’t need to break in if they can manipulate someone into letting them in. That shift has fueled a surge in fraud, with <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-releases-annual-internet-crime-report">more than $16 billion</a> drained from bank accounts last year in the U.S. alone, skyrocketing from $3 billion five years earlier. Given vast underreporting, the amount stolen through fraud crimes is <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/federal-trade-commission-protecting-older-adults-report_102024.pdf">likely far higher</a>.</p>
<p>One way Microsoft is countering these threats is by partnering user experience (UX) designers with threat analysts, helping make protection intuitive so people don’t have to be experts to stay safe online. Its new <a href="https://microsoft.design/articles/secure-by-design-a-ux-toolkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure by Design UX Toolkit</a>, tested across 20 product teams, is now available to other companies and organizations, too, to help them build safer digital experiences. </p>
<p>Cybercriminals “have been taking advantage of how our brains work” through social engineering — manipulating people into believing and acting on something that isn’t true, says Kathy Stokes, the director of fraud prevention programs for AARP, a nonprofit that advocates for older adults in the U.S.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-1-2-3-1-683x683.jpg" alt="A stylized illustration showing a hand holding a floating cube with an eye and shield symbol, surrounded by flowing ribbons against a coral background with decorative elements." class="wp-image-21415" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c01ee564352e3f69ac462f80bf3a5959">“Education is an important part of solving the fraud crisis, but guess what else is an important part? Technology that comes to us secure by design and safe by default,” Stokes says. “We put so much of the onus on the end user to be safe, and it&#8217;s not a fair battle.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-d1c9e4658c31f8d99f7de6ce84c91261">That’s exactly the imbalance Margaret Price set out to fix. As a senior director of strategy at Microsoft, Price says she made it her mission last year to change how the company’s tens of thousands of product managers, user researchers, designers and others think about security — by seeing design as a first line of defense.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c79ee558f900edfbe2e02a8835086ce4">“Most security issues are caused by human error,” Price says. “Whether it’s a stolen credential, a confusing privacy setting or accidentally exposed data, these are often outcomes of poor design.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0e6e0f62f7610f0558ef120269ffd8f7">Price’s efforts stemmed from the company-wide <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/11/02/secure-future-initiative-sfi-cybersecurity-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secure Future Initiative</a> that rolled out in 2023 and made security every employee’s top priority. Price gathered a team and interviewed more than 70 security experts to understand common vulnerabilities and learn how cybercriminals exploit design gaps. The result: a toolkit that helps product teams bake security into the user experience from the start, instead of retrofitting for it later. The toolkit has rolled out to 22,000 employees, and now other companies are starting to use it to help them design safer, more intuitive experiences using Microsoft products.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2bae19c8ff6138ef75dea43caeef8f4a">It&#8217;s a distinct approach and a new way of thinking about both security and product development.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-3-3-683x683.png" alt="A person typing on a laptop surrounded by digital security symbols including cubes with eye and shield icons, password asterisks, and fingerprint elements on a yellow and black background." class="wp-image-21423" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-02febe3d6cce415a2b8f6efa5b821977">UX has usually been an afterthought in security, says David Weston, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and OS security. Product teams didn’t realize for quite some time that if users were flooded with yes-or-no prompts, for example, they’d be habituated to clicking through without really reading risk alerts.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-891713a37d2152adc22a2348bd9d9d6c">“Sometimes the impact was catastrophic,” he recalls, noting the recent shift toward seeing designers as “our most important defenders” has made a “night and day” difference.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-bef6cfc303a4fb385462ea667ef4f8e1">This design-first approach is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/17/microsofts-secure-by-design-journey-one-year-of-success/">already showing up</a> in Microsoft products, says Marcus Ash, who leads design and research for Windows.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-daa91c17b971e28a779a7c1de08d7b44">Smart App Control uses AI to block unknown or suspicious apps from running. It not only stops the threat but explains why and suggests safer alternatives from Microsoft’s app store, effectively extending the reach of security professionals to everyday users.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-313b42fab8951e2727d33f4215c6aacd">Microsoft Teams phishing alerts now display full email addresses, rather than just a name, to expose impersonators and flag when a domain doesn’t match a sender’s claimed company.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-19e6b23121ea3eeb3536a3770b5ad974">And <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-passkey">passkeys</a> are replacing passwords with more secure authentication methods that are simpler to use as well, like facial recognition or a PIN through the Windows Hello sign-in experience that only works on your machine and can’t be shared or stolen. As of May 1, all new Microsoft accounts have gone <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/05/01/pushing-passkeys-forward-microsofts-latest-updates-for-simpler-safer-sign-ins/">password-free</a>.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-44a24cb69777f661b4c0f87ec3fd37d0">That new technology is a great example of how good design goes hand-in-hand with communication to help users make better security decisions, Weston says. Powerful advances in security can’t protect users if they don’t understand them or how to adopt them — something that’s even more important since Windows is an open platform that gives users more choice than other operating systems do, he says.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-2-2-3-683x683.png" alt="A collage illustration showing a hand holding a padlock with 'AI' text, surrounded by flowing black lines, social media icons, and digital elements on a coral background." class="wp-image-21416" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a777077aec1e2ba11ef440e8ee2d1e38">“A lot of our recent security work is about simplifying,” Ash says, “making it easier for our users to understand when they need to jump into something and correct it.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6de126e7de1e62566a24da6e81561cc1">Trust and clarity are especially important, says Alistair Kilpatrick, principal design director for Windows, as technology moves toward an agentic future — a world where AI-powered agents can act on users’ behalf, with their permission, and access to their personal data and credit card information.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-edf2ddef0193bf33d74d447382c74a3f">“These foundations need to be there in place to build customer trust,” Kilpatrick says.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7912b1b6edc43c620129d522f19ba82e">The right amount of friction is key — making security features less complicated and easier to enact so people aren’t loathe to adopt them, while also alerting users to danger in a way that forces them to take notice.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-149fadd2e7a964bab195546fe43e0602">Tech companies can help users understand that friction “is not a four-letter word,” AARP’s Stokes says. “Friction is a protection.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6b0a63c0f99a4ad1c8e34c1ba0abc67a">Even small design choices as simple as where a button is placed, how a pop-up alert is worded, or whether the look of a page or program is consistent with others can help users recognize when something is off and avoid danger.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="683" height="683" src="https://msthesource.thesourcemediaassets.com/2025/07/Image-4-2-683x683.jpg" alt="A person using a laptop with cybersecurity elements including a padlock, password symbols, security cubes with eye and shield icons, and digital interface graphics on a coral and yellow background." class="wp-image-21412" /></figure>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-94a885816bbddf05c9eaf31626dccede">“You&#8217;re a gamer, you&#8217;re someone that&#8217;s a creative, you&#8217;re someone that&#8217;s trying to be productive, we don&#8217;t want you to worry about these things,” Ash says. “We design a simple user experience that is secure by default. This helps our users understand the protection we put in place and the risks if they decide to make changes.”</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c3b960ca37d4a667fcc8c5fad61bebe1">Cybercrime isn’t just a tech issue — it’s a <a href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/fbi-report-fraud-2024/?intcmp=AE-FRDSC-MOR-R2-POS3">public safety crisis</a>, Stokes says. Scams are draining retirement funds, eroding trust and leaving people vulnerable and dependent on social safety nets. To help people resist the emotional manipulation behind modern tech scams, AARP has launched a national campaign with an easy-to-remember mantra meant to help users in the same way broad seatbelt or fire-drill campaigns have done in the past: <a href="https://www.aarp.org/videos/money/scams-fraud/6373940168112.html">“Pause. Reflect. Protect.”</a></p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2fdb935058ec06f54f5e4410433a95e8">That’s why Microsoft is innovating to make security feel less like a burden and more like a built-in benefit, Price says.</p>
<p class="has-white-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-176e81afdda5657f21ce0e7d51dcde42">“We want security to be woven into everyday products to make experiences safer for everyone,” Price says. “That would mean fewer scams, fewer account breaches, more confidence and more trust in the digital tools people use every day.”</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI offers retail and consumer goods brands a wealth of solutions that transform creativity and reduce time and cost of resource-intensive tasks across the content supply chain. As witnessed at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity in June 2025, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-advertising-industry-parties-in-cannes-with-ai-as-its-new-plus-one-00443954?msockid=331ef648934d63d435b8e27a92f76280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI is the new “plus one”</a> to marketing chiefs and agency leaders. However, the potential of AI unleashed new pressure to chief marketing officers to not only scale proof of concepts (POCs), but prove their value—all while keeping the marketing engine running at a breakneck pace.</p>
<p>For consumer packaged goods (CPGs), delivering personalized content across channels requires multiple iterations of product images, constant reshoots, tweaks, packaging design adjustments, and localization by region. This can be all-consuming for creatives, who are rebuilding or recreating imagery constantly to meet the moment.</p>
<div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex">
<div class="wp-block-button"><a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/retail/microsoft-cloud-for-retail">Discover solutions with Microsoft Cloud for Retail</a></div>
</div>
<p>Imagine if brands could leverage AI <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/digital-twin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital twins</a> to create and integrate high-quality, personalized product content at scale—simply, cost-effectively, and in a fraction of the time. AI and 3D digital twins make it possible, proving AI investments deliver on reduced time and speed to innovation.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/retail/2025/01/16/how-cmos-can-personalize-marketing-and-optimize-spend-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent post</a>, we discussed how AI isn’t just a tool—it’s the foundation for building competitive advantage. Let’s walk through three strategic areas where digital twins offer exceptional outcomes for marketing teams looking to deliver more.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-starting-with-product-imagery">1. Starting with product imagery</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/how-ai-helping-cmos-their-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to EMARKETER</a>, content creation will be the top budget priority AI use case for chief marketing officers worldwide. Why? Producing product images today requires brands to spend a massive chunk of their budget to constantly reshoot and edit images. With digital twins, brands have the flexibility and scalability at low cost to create thousands of variants on a single product image, including labels, packaging, and language formats—all within a single file.</p>
<p>AI empowers not only productivity but <em>creativity</em>. Digital twins are hyper-realistic, enabling content managers to easily and endlessly modify or expand on a concept using a 3D product model with a few clicks. Creatives can reallocate time spent in operational “to do’s” to storytelling, strategy, and delivery by channel. Brands can even showcase products in both static and dynamic formats because AI models aren’t limited to one dimension.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Digital twins for product images, videos, and interactive experiences simplify content workflows and allow you to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Generate endless product images or videos using a single digital twin.</li>
<li>Refresh imagery for markets or seasons without reshoots.</li>
<li>Reduce repetitive labor for creatives while shortening production timelines.</li>
<li>Test creative concepts instantly without adding costs.</li>
<li>Update visuals across brands seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="making-it-real-nestle-reduces-associated-time-and-cost-by-70-with-scaling-digital-twins">Making it real: Nestlé reduces associated time and cost by 70% with scaling digital twins</h3>
<p>Recently, Nestlé—the world’s largest food and beverage company—collaborated with Microsoft, <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-song-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Accenture Song</a>, and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/retail-agentic-physical-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA</a> to build and launch a new AI-powered in-house service to create high-quality product content at scale.</p>
<p>With its new digital twin content supply chain powered by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA Omniverse</a> on <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Azure</a> and using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft AI solutions</a>, content creators across Nestlé’s 45 content studios around the world can deliver high-quality creative assets at scale for e-commerce and marketing communications. Nestlé’s Integrated Marketing Services (IMS)—250 marketing experts in seven hubs—are working on scaling the digital twins and driving content localization.</p>
<p>Nestlé already has a baseline of 4,000 3D digital products, mainly for global brands, with the ambition to convert a total of 10,000 products into digital twins in the next two years across global and local brands.</p>
<p><strong>Proving the value of AI investments in digital twins</strong>:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>70% reduced time and cost associated with scaling digital twins.</li>
<li>Faster content production for several brands, including Purina, Nescafé Dolce Gusto, and Nespresso.</li>
<li>Better ability to position iconic brands in a fast-moving digital environment.</li>
<li>Seamless updates for seasonal campaigns or channel-specific formats.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Nestlé, these technologies are proving to be catalysts for creative ingenuity, revolutionizing creative workflows in design, supercharging content creation, and enabling nuanced personalization—positioning Nestlé at the forefront of marketing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-digital-twins-enable-game-changing-one-to-one-consumer-experiences">2. Digital twins enable game-changing one-to-one consumer experiences</h2>
<p>Digital twins are generating realistic virtual experiences that not only enhance the shopper journey but also hyper-personalize each touchpoint to create memorable brand moments. AI has enabled interoperability between datasets to unlock online configurators, virtual reality product trials and visualizations, and in-store displays.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Embedding AI in user experiences is allowing consumer and retail goods companies to enable:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Try-ons for beauty products and fashion.</li>
<li>Configurators for custom merchandise.</li>
<li>Interactive, 360-degree product views.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-next-level-media-and-creative-together-at-last">3. Next level: Media and creative, together at last</h2>
<p>The era of AI ushers in a world of “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/ai-at-work-intelligence-on-tap-will-reshape-knowledge-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intelligence on tap</a>.”</p>
<p>Imagine if AI-powered digital product twins merge product imagery and consumer insights to create visuals targeted to specific audience segments or even individual customers.</p>
<p>A combination of insights and digital twin content creation empowers marketers to optimize for better impact and even map future trends. The value of building digital twins goes beyond endless product image creation. CPG brands are now leveraging AI to connect real-time campaign insights to their content studios as a primary use case to prove value. Agents are being built to perform audience simulations, test images, content, and even segmentation strategy to drive higher return on ad spend (ROAS) or even predict impact.</p>
<p><strong>Net-net</strong>: Use AI to connect media insights and content to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Simulate, refine, and test marketing scenarios and consumer responses.</li>
<li>Increase campaign effectiveness with real-time, iterative feedback.</li>
<li>Test and optimize personalized marketing strategies at scale.</li>
<li>Model customer segments and predict campaign outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-as-a-tool-to-amplify-human-creativity">AI as a tool to amplify human creativity</h2>
<p>As AI continues to evolve traditional processes and enhance productivity, marketers know human creativity remains a critical resource. With digital simulations and AI together, you can reallocate your valuable resources to more strategic, creative tasks; reduce costs and risk; and help your marketing teams optimize spend and focus on your number one KPI: growth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficiency-without-compromise">Efficiency without compromise&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning balances math reasoning ability with efficiency, making it potentially suitable for educational applications, real-time logic-based applications, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Similar to its predecessor, Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is a 3.8 billion parameter open model optimized for advanced math reasoning. It supports a 64K token context length and is fine-tuned on high-quality synthetic data to deliver reliable, logic-intensive performance deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-s-new">What&#8217;s new?</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At the core of Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is the newly introduced decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture, SambaY, whose central innovation is the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet effective mechanism for sharing representations between layers.&nbsp; The architecture includes a self-decoder that combines Mamba (a State Space Model) and Sliding Window Attention (SWA), along with a single layer of full attention. The architecture also involves a cross-decoder that interleaves expensive cross-attention layers with the new, efficient GMUs. This new architecture with GMU modules&nbsp;drastically improves decoding efficiency, boosts long-context retrieval performance and enables the architecture to deliver exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Key benefits of the SambaY architecture include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Enhanced decoding efficiency.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Preserves linear prefiling time complexity.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Increased scalability and enhanced long context performance.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">Up to 10 times higher throughput.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Decoder-hybrid-decoder-architecture.webp" alt="A diagram of a computer program" class="wp-image-44177 webp-format" data-orig-src="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Decoder-hybrid-decoder-architecture.webp"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Our decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture taking Samba [RLL+25] as the self-decoder. Gated Memory Units (GMUs) are interleaved with the cross-attention layers in the cross-decoder to reduce the decoding computation complexity. As in YOCO [SDZ+24], the full attention layer only computes the KV cache during the prefilling with the self-decoder, leading to linear computation complexity for the prefill stage.</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning-benchmarks">Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning benchmarks&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Like all models in the Phi family, Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning is deployable on a single GPU, making it accessible for a broad range of use cases. However, what sets it apart is its architectural advantage. This new model achieves significantly lower latency and higher throughput compared to Phi-4-mini-reasoning, particularly in long-context generation and latency-sensitive reasoning tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This makes Phi-4-mini-flash-reasoning a compelling option for developers and enterprises looking to deploy intelligent systems that require fast, scalable, and efficient reasoning—whether on premises or on-device.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-agents-and-knowledge-work-meeting-the-next-frontier-of-research-automation">AI agents and knowledge work: Meeting the next frontier of research automation</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Generative AI and large language models have made research and analysis faster than ever, powering solutions like ChatGPT Deep Research and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/researcher-agent-in-microsoft-365-copilot/4397186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Researcher in Microsoft 365 Copilot</a> for individuals and teams. These tools are transforming everyday productivity and document workflows for millions of users.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">As organizations look to take the next step—integrating deep research directly into their business apps, automating multi-step processes, and governing knowledge at enterprise scale—the need for programmable, composable, and auditable research automation becomes clear.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This is where Azure AI Foundry and Deep Research come in: offering the flexibility to embed, extend, and orchestrate world-class research as a service across your entire enterprise ecosystem—and connect it with your data and your systems.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deep-research-capabilities-in-azure-ai-foundry-agent-service">Deep Research capabilities in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Deep Research in Foundry Agent Service is built for developers who want to move beyond the chat window. By offering Deep Research as a composable agent tool via API and SDK, Azure AI Foundry enables customers to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Automate web-scale research</strong> using a best-in-class research model grounded with Bing Search, with every insight traceable and source-backed.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Programmatically build agents</strong> that can be invoked by apps, workflows, or other agents—turning deep research into a reusable, production-ready service.</li>

<div class="ms-metrics-youtube-player"></div>
</p></div>
</p></div>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Unlike packaged chat assistants, Deep Research in Foundry Agent Service can evolve with your needs—ready for automation, extensibility, and integration with future internal data sources as we expand support.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-it-works-architecture-and-agent-flow">How it works: Architecture and agent flow</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Deep Research in Foundry Agent Service is architected for flexibility, transparency, and composability—so you can automate research that’s as robust as your business demands.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">At its core, the Deep Research model, o3-deep-research,&nbsp;orchestrates a <strong>multi-step research pipeline</strong> that’s tightly integrated with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounding with Bing Search</a>&nbsp;and leverages the latest OpenAI models:</p>
<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Clarifying intent and scoping the task:</strong><br />When a user or downstream app submits a research query, the agent uses GPT-series models including GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 to clarify the question, gather additional context if needed, and precisely scope the research task. This ensures the agent’s output is both relevant and actionable, and that every search is optimized for your business scenario.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Web grounding with Bing Search:</strong><br />Once the task is scoped, the agent securely invokes the Grounding with Bing Search tool to gather a curated set of high-quality, recent web data. This ensures the research model is working from a foundation of authoritative, up-to-date sources—no hallucinations from stale or irrelevant content.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Deep Research task execution:</strong><br />The o3-deep-research model starts the&nbsp;research task&nbsp;execution. This involves&nbsp;thinking, analyzing, and synthesizing information across all discovered sources. Unlike simple summarization, it reasons step-by-step, pivots as it encounters new insights, and composes a comprehensive answer that’s sensitive to nuance, ambiguity, and emerging patterns in the data.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Transparency, safety, and compliance:</strong><br />The final output is a structured report that documents not only the answer, but also the model’s reasoning path, source citations, and any clarifications requested during the session. This makes every answer fully auditable—a must-have for regulated industries and high-stakes use cases.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong><strong>Programmatic integration and composition</strong>:</strong><br />By exposing Deep Research as an API, Azure AI Foundry empowers you to invoke research from anywhere—custom business apps, internal portals, workflow automation tools, or as part of a larger agent ecosystem. For example, you can trigger a research agent as part of a multi-agent chain: one agent performs deep web analysis, another generates a slide deck with Azure Functions, while a third emails the result to decision makers with <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/logic-apps/?msockid=36d156f74ff96d723016422b4e966cdb">Azure Logic Apps</a>. This composability is the real game-changer: research is no longer a manual, one-off task, but a building block for digital transformation and continuous intelligence.</li>
</ol>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This flexible architecture means Deep Research can be seamlessly embedded into a wide range of enterprise workflows and applications. Already, organizations across industries are evaluating how these programmable research agents can streamline high-value scenarios—from market analysis and competitive intelligence, to large-scale analytics and regulatory reporting.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Pricing for Deep Research (model: <strong>o3-deep-research</strong>) is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Input:</strong> $10.00 per 1M tokens.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Cached Input:</strong> $2.50 per 1M tokens.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Output:</strong> $40.00 per 1M tokens.</li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Search context tokens are charged input token prices for the model being used.<strong> </strong>You’ll separately incur charges for <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/grounding-pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grounding with Bing Search</a> and the base GPT model being used for clarifying questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-with-scaling-generative-ai-on-premises">Challenges with scaling generative AI on-premises&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Scaling generative AI is like designing transportation systems for a rapidly growing city. Just as urban expansion demands modern transportation infrastructure to function efficiently, AI leaders understand that implementing AI in a meaningful way requires a cloud foundation that is powerful, flexible, and built to handle future demand. AI leaders recognize that the power and agility of the cloud is needed to achieve their desired outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item">In fact, 72% of surveyed respondents whose organization migration to Azure for AI-readiness reported that the migration was necessary or reduced the barriers to enabling AI.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item">65% of business leaders agreed that deploying generative AI in the cloud would meet their organizational objectives to avoid restrictions and limitations of on-prem deployments.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Businesses that run most or all of their generative AI workloads on-premises face significant roadblocks. On-premises systems, often lacking the agility offered by the cloud, resemble outdated roadways—prone to congestion, difficult to maintain, expensive to expand, and ill-equipped for today’s demands. Businesses attempting to scale AI in these environments encounter complicated obstacles—including infrastructure limitations, a shortage of specialized talent, and integration challenges that slow innovation—that are frustrating to overcome. Challenges like limited network bandwidth and fragmented data environments further complicate adoption.</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Deploying generative AI safely is crucial to protecting sensitive data, maintaining compliance, and mitigating risk. Surveyed decision-makers identified four key areas of concerns:&nbsp;</p>
<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Data privacy risks</strong>, especially with the proliferation of AI-generated content.</li>
<li class="wp-block-list-item"><strong>Lack of expertise </strong>regarding generative AI security best practices.</li>
