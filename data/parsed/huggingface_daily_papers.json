      "summary": "The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as\nmotivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing.\nUniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful\nproperties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for\nMachine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.\n  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model\narchitecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \\n\nlocally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical\nfoundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like\nperformance.\n  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space\nsequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits\na GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws:\nempirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at\nthe same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.\n  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during\ninference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using\nspiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses\nstrengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept\nwhile processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a\ngraph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model\nis biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human\nneurons could use to achieve speech.\n  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse\nand positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks.\nInterpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and\nmodel parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.",

      "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

Long video generation presents\nchallenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing\nmodels can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to\nbidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for\nfaster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory\nchallenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based\ngeneration, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are\ncritical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in\nreal time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,\nespecially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt\ntransitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level\nAR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states\nwith new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable\nlong video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);\nand short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as\nframe sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.\nWith these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model\nto minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains\n20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both\nshort and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single\nH100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal\nquality loss.",

Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,\ntwo-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local\ncontent recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout\nanalysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing\nthe computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second\nstage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on\nnative-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving\nfine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support\nthis strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,\nlarge-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,\nMinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both\ngeneral-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,\nwhile maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.",

Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation\nshow that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as\nGPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL\n72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency.\nFor example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\\% GPU\nmemory cost and 8.7\\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.",

We identify the root cause: the absence of robust agentic\nfoundation models forces models during post-training to simultaneously learn\ndiverse agentic behaviors while aligning them to expert demonstrations, thereby\ncreating fundamental optimization tensions. To this end, we are the first to\npropose incorporating Agentic Continual Pre-training (Agentic CPT) into the\ndeep research agents training pipeline to build powerful agentic foundational\nmodels.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce WebWeaver, a novel dual-agent framework that emulates the human\nresearch process.

By performing targeted retrieval of\nonly the necessary evidence from the memory bank for each part, it effectively\nmitigates long-context issues. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art\nacross major OEDR benchmarks, including DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and\nDeepResearchGym.

      "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents demonstrate strong performance on\nknowledge-intensive tasks but are hindered by context window limitations in\nparadigms like ReAct. Complex queries involving multiple entities, intertwined\nrelationships, and high uncertainty demand extensive search cycles that rapidly\nexhaust context budgets before reaching complete solutions. To overcome this\nchallenge, we introduce ReSum, a novel paradigm that enables indefinite\nexploration through periodic context summarization. ReSum converts growing\ninteraction histories into compact reasoning states, maintaining awareness of\nprior discoveries while bypassing context constraints. For paradigm adaptation,\nwe propose ReSum-GRPO, integrating GRPO with segmented trajectory training and\nadvantage broadcasting to familiarize agents with summary-conditioned\nreasoning. Extensive experiments on web agents of varying scales across three\nbenchmarks demonstrate that ReSum delivers an average absolute improvement of\n4.5\\% over ReAct, with further gains of up to 8.2\\% following ReSum-GRPO\ntraining. Notably, with only 1K training samples, our WebResummer-30B (a\nReSum-GRPO-trained version of WebSailor-30B) achieves 33.3\\% Pass@1 on\nBrowseComp-zh and 18.3\\% on BrowseComp-en, surpassing existing open-source web\nagents.",
