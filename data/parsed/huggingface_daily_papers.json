      "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own\nexperience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.\nHowever, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning\nremains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards\n(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn\ntool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on\nexpert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This\nlimitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a\nnarrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment\ndiversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call\nearly experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where\nthe resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within\nthis paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world\nmodeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment\ndynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal\nactions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight\ndiverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently\nimprove effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value\nof early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our\nresults provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong\nfoundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical\nbridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

Beyond efficiency, our findings show that\nquantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and\nenabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize\nexploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,\nwhich dynamically adjusts noise during training.

      "summary": "Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a\nlatent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for\nDiffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely\nevolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which\nintroduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise\narchitectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict\ninformation capacity, and weak representations that result from purely\nreconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this\nwork, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders\n(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term\nRepresentation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality\nreconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a\nscalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are\ntypically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers\nto operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,\npropose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our\napproach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment\nlosses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we\nachieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no\nguidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance).

However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a\ncompact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style\ndynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to\nenable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports\n109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables,\nformulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through\ncomprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house\nbenchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document\nparsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing\nsolutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers\nfast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical\ndeployment in real-world scenarios.",

In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and\nexploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy\noptimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as\nanswer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are\nrewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to\ninternalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct\na systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable\nrapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining\nreasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on\nthese insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which\npresents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling\nthe policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing\nstable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable\nreasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively\ndetect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)\nwith a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.\nExperiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome\ncorrectness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the\ntoken budget.",

Modern knowledge repositories are\ninherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual\nelements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG\nframeworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when\nprocessing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework\nthat enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our\napproach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge\nentities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph\nconstruction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics\nwithin a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that\ncombines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables\neffective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans\nmultiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on\nchallenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on\nlong documents where traditional approaches fail.

On\nfev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,\nChronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over\nexisting models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms\nbaselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains\nfurther highlight its practical advantages.

However, their performance in specialized\nreal-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating\nexternal tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic\nreinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely\non costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output\ndistribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the\noutput distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which\nis a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data\nscarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we\npropose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),\na cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any\nparameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage\ninstead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling\nhigh-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal\nground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is\nseamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments\non mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that\nTraining-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly\nimproves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,\nTraining-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training\ndata and cost.",
