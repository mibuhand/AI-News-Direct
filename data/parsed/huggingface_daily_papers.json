      "summary": "\"Thinking with Text\" and \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm significantly\nimprove the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

      "summary": "Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach\nwithin the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance\nreasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during\ninference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations\nremain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the\nperspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two\ndominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key\nlimitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while\nperplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the\nestimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a\nhybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key\ncomponents: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity\nConsistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting\nthe convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while\npreserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating\nlow-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical\nresults across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong\npotential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning\nperformance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence\nreliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%.

Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.",

However, current Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate\nfluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing\nparadigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and\nlow-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.\nWe propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses\nthis limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code\nrepresentation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as\nabstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes\ninto finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This\nrecursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,\nenabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.\nFurthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,\nmulti-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical\ndecision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly\nsurpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates\nexceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that\nunifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful\nand effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

Its core component is PaddleOCR-VL-0.9B, a\ncompact yet powerful vision-language model (VLM) that integrates a NaViT-style\ndynamic resolution visual encoder with the ERNIE-4.5-0.3B language model to\nenable accurate element recognition. This innovative model efficiently supports\n109 languages and excels in recognizing complex elements (e.g., text, tables,\nformulas, and charts), while maintaining minimal resource consumption. Through\ncomprehensive evaluations on widely used public benchmarks and in-house\nbenchmarks, PaddleOCR-VL achieves SOTA performance in both page-level document\nparsing and element-level recognition. It significantly outperforms existing\nsolutions, exhibits strong competitiveness against top-tier VLMs, and delivers\nfast inference speeds. These strengths make it highly suitable for practical\ndeployment in real-world scenarios.",

In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and\nexploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy\noptimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as\nanswer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are\nrewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to\ninternalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct\na systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable\nrapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining\nreasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on\nthese insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which\npresents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling\nthe policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing\nstable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable\nreasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively\ndetect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)\nwith a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.\nExperiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome\ncorrectness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the\ntoken budget.",

We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of\nhandling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in\na zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that\nfacilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing\nacross multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related\nseries, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a\nforecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on\nsynthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate\nseries. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three\ncomprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On\nfev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,\nChronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over\nexisting models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms\nbaselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains\nfurther highlight its practical advantages.

Recent workflow-based\ndata agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain\nfundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their\nreliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,\nthe first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of\nautomatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to\nanalyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science\ntasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates\nthe learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to\nprogressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world\nenvironments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework\nthat constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,\nDeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data\nquestion answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data\nresearch. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze\noutperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary\nLLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,\npaving the way toward autonomous data science.",
