    <summary>Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators.</summary>

    <summary>Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is critical in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should offer deep insights into these systems at the electronic level but are limited by their steep computational cost. Here, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably reach ‘gold standard’ accuracy in quantum chemistry for extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multi-resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving consistency between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references. This advances the simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, enabling reliable and improvable first-principles modeling of such problems by ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</summary>

    <summary>PXDesign achieves nanomolar binder hit rates of 20–73% across five of six diverse protein targets, surpassing prior methods such as AlphaProteo. This experimental success rate is enabled by advances in both binder generation and filtering. We develop both a diffusion-based generative model (PXDesign-d) and a hallucination-based approach (PXDesign-h), each showing strong in silico performance that outperforms existing models. Beyond generation, we systematically analyze confidence-based filtering and ranking strategies from multiple structure predictors, comparing their accuracy, efficiency, and complementarity on datasets spanning de novo binders and mutagenesis. Finally, we validate the full design process experimentally, achieving high hit rates and multiple nanomolar binders.

To support future work and community use, we release a unified benchmarking framework at https://github.com/bytedance/PXDesignBench, provide public access to PXDesign via a webserver at https://protenix-server.com, and share all designed binder sequences at https://protenix.github.io/pxdesign.</summary>

    <title>Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning</title>

    <category term="Robotics"/>
    <summary>We introduce Robix, a unified vision-language model designed to serve as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, integrating robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single architecture. Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for low-level controllers alongside verbal responses for human interaction, enabling end-to-end execution of complex instructions, long-horizon task planning, and natural human-robot collaboration. The model also introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix employs chain-of-thought reasoning and is trained through a three-stage strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance embodied reasoning skills like 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments show that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines—including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro—in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</summary>

    <title>Seed-Prover: Deep and Broad Reasoning for Automated Theorem Proving</title>

    <summary>LLMs have demonstrated strong mathematical reasoning abilities by leveraging reinforcement learning with long chain-of-thought, yet they continue to struggle with theorem proving due to the lack of clear supervision signals when solely using natural language. Dedicated domain-specific languages like Lean provide clear supervision via formal verification of proofs, enabling effective training through reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose \textbf{Seed-Prover}, a lemma-style whole-proof reasoning model. Seed-Prover can iteratively refine its proof based on Lean feedback, proved lemmas, and self-summarization. To solve IMO-level contest problems, we design three test-time inference strategies that enable both deep and broad reasoning. Seed-Prover proves 78.1% of formalized past IMO problems, saturates MiniF2F, and achieves over 50\% on PutnamBench, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin. To address the lack of geometry support in Lean, we introduce a geometry reasoning engine \textbf{Seed-Geometry}, which outperforms previous formal geometry engines. We use these two systems to participate in IMO 2025 and fully prove 5 out of 6 problems. This work represents a significant advancement in automated mathematical reasoning, demonstrating the effectiveness of formal verification with long chain-of-thought reasoning.</summary>

    <summary>Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study, we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency, validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios. Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.</summary>
